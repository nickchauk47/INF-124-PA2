The website is an e-commerce site where it sells Rick and Morty merchandise and gear. To navigate throughout the website, there is a top bar that links to all the different pages. To go home, just click the top banner that is visible on every page.

### Products Generated by Database
Requirements: 1
All the products on the home page and the products list and the order page are all pulled from the database. When the user selects a product, the product details page will also pull the corresponding details from the database using PHP and MySQL.

### Order Stored in Database
Requirements: 2
When the user submits an order, the order gets populated in the table in the database with all the information of the order. The form also makes sure that the data being inserted is in the correct format.

### Confirmation Page
Requirements: 3
When the order gets submitted, a confirmation page shows up to let the user know of all the order information.

### Ajax
Requirements: 4
One way we used Ajax was to auto-suggest state initials for the State field in the order form. When the user starts typing, Ajax will read from an XML and provide suggestions. The other way we used Ajax was to dynamically show the shipping rates at the bottom of the form. The shipping rates are also pulled from an XML file and will show when the user presses the button.
