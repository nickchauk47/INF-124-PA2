<h1>ABOUT US</h1>

    <p>The company was started in April 2018 in order to satisfy the high demand of Rick and Morty merchandise. Yi-Heng and Nick were in the same CS 137 class at UCI when they decided to work together to build a website to sell Rick and Morty merchandise. Before they started the company, Rick and Morty gear was expensive and rare. There was a high demand for these products, but not enough manufacturers. After learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript from Professor Malek, they had all the tools they needed to build the first ever Rick and Morty Fan Store. The company has grown exponentially and is the top place to get all your Rick and Morty gear.</p>
